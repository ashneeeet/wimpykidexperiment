<h3> The Big Page of Greg Heffley </h3>

<p> So, I see you're interested in knowing me, eh? Lemme depict some of the things I enjoy (more or less to the 
same level as sleep!)</p>

<div class="contents" style="background-color:black; color:white; font-family:Comic Sans MS; padding:10px; margin-left:40px; margin-right:40px">

<h3> <u> Contents </u> </h3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="#fam" style="text-decoration:none; color:white"> My Family </a> </li>
<li> <a href="#friend" style="text-decoration:none; color:white"> My Friend Rowley Jefferson </a> </li>

<h3 id="fam"> My Family </a> </h3>

<p>I have a family that I find tough to survive in. No, not because they are bad, but 
because I'm too good for them. Nah, not a narcissistic person, but just a big introvert who should be surrounded by better humans 
(pets are allowed, except pigs). If I'd want to remove someone from my family, it'll be Manny, my little brother, who is cute to the world 
but a menace to me tbh. I have an  overprotectice and overenthusiastic mum, a 9-5 office-slave dad who has to cope with the family drama that 
my mum keeps creating, a band-enthusiast and useless older brother too.

<h3 id="friend"> My Friend Rowley Jefferson </a> </h3>

<p>I mean I love him but.. he's just the only person I can call a friend. </p>

<h3 id="society"> My Social Life </a> </h3>

<p>A middle schooler's social life usually sucks if he's not popular at school and is mostly in some corner trying to hide from bullies.
Yeah, I'm talking about my own self. My social life includes my school, my neighbourhood, any party if I luckily get invited to once in a blue moon,
and thus, ofcourse, pretty much non-existent. </p>
